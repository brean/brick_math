# brick_math
Python library to make calculation with bricks easier

## Ideas
- check, if bricks connect correctly at the studs (save stud positions and center, assure the stud dimensions fit)
- connect bricks next to/ontop of each other as wall
- assure that all bricks of a wall are connected
- connect to part ids
- create brick-figures from complex shapes (arches, maybe based on splines)
- create landscapes from perlin noise (similar to minecraft)
- hollow-out objects
- visualize (pyscript in monaco-editor on one side, threlte and the parts ldparts-library as preview on the other side, similar to https://brean.github.io/svelte-pyscript-pathfinding/)
- connector types (TECHNIC-connectors are different from studs)
